### **Adapter**

* You don't have to prepare for every case and put everything in the class, creating messy code.
* Except of that you can create adapter, use some things, modify how they work etc.
* Adapters connects parts of code that originally can't be connected with each other. 
* They can be used also as filters to help you create your own standard of code/way how things work.
* It improves scalability of your code.

### **Decorator**

* Extends (decorates) object dinamically.
* Decorator object extends original object.
* Decorator adds or/and overrides functionality of object.
* In JavaScript Extends or Mixins works kinda based on decorator pattern.
* That way we can extend original object without modifying it itself.
* Can be used for example to manage auth user roles, and many other cases.
